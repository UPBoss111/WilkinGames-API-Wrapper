# WilkinGames-API-Wrapper
Contains wrappers (Python, JS, etc) for the APIs of the games Dinogen Online, Deadswitch 3, and Arsenal Online. The games and the APIs themselves are made by @WilkinGames, but these wrappers are meant to be used inside their respective languages and make it a bit easier to process the web requests.

Anyone can use these files, but we have no documentation at this time.
